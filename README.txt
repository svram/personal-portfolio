The obligatory Personal Portfolio page. This one is done using Bootstrap and JQuery. 

Status: Ongoing. I am in the process of building this page out with better UI/UX. 
It may look clunky but it's a work in progress :) Any suggesitons would be welcome. 

I have deployed this on heroku. Check it out here:

https://vikrambahl.herokuapp.com

I have connected by Heroku prject to my Github profile and enabled automatic deploys. That way, whenever I push
changes to Github, the deltas are pushed to Heroku via a web hook.
